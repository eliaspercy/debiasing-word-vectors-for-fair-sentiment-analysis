Implementation of the adversarial in-processing debiasing method for word vectors, originally detailed in https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3351095.3372837, verified by debiasing demographic word vectors from amongst 200,000 word2vec word vectors and analysing the results of sentiment analysis performed using these word vectors with respect to sentences containing demographic identity terms.
